# CSV-RDF-Mapper

Converts tabular data (`csv`) to rdf (`turtle / text`) utilizing [SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/). The CSV-RDF-Mapper is an MVP to showcase a workflow to populate tabular data into a data graph. Current functionalities are mainly for showcase purposes and are not complete. A minimal shape graph and tabular data is included in the examples and embedded into the [https://winroger.github.io/csv-rdf-mapper/](https://ulb-darmstadt.github.io/csv-rdf-mapper/).

## Demo

[Live Demo]([https://winroger.github.io/csv-rdf-mapper/](https://ulb-darmstadt.github.io/csv-rdf-mapper/))

## Project information

The tool was developed during the NFDI4Ing Seed Fund: [RDM-Workflows for construction engineering and architecture](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7802981).

## Features

- Conversion of `csv` data to `turtle / text` format using `shacl` for structuring.
- Example datasets and shape graph provided to demonstrate functionality in the [Demo](https://winroger.github.io/csv-rdf-mapper/).

## Planned Features

- Implement [rdf-validate-shacl](https://github.com/zazuko/rdf-validate-shacl) for validation
- Fix how nodeshapes are represented in the datagraph (see f.e. `n0:`)
- Extend functionalities how Shapegraph are populated, currently only supporting `nodeshapes` and `nodeShapeProperties` for demonstration.

## Technologies Used

- Vue.js (3.3.4)
- TypeScript (4.5.5)
- [rdflib.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rdflib)
- [papaparse](https://www.npmjs.com/package/papaparse)
